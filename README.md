I'm Kelly, a recent computer science graduate of Carleton College working in IT. When I'm not imaging computers, troubleshooting, or internalizing the latest Microsoft update, I like to learn and write about cybersecurity, digital privacy,  open source software, and artificial intelligence.

I am currently working on creating a website to host my blog.

My GitHub is place for past school projects, current cybersecurity projects, and tinkering with Linux and other open source tools.

I also enjoy biking, reading, podcasts, playing and listening to music, and skipping stones.

Feel free to contact me at kellymcgucken@gmail.com to discuss any of the aforementioned subjects.
